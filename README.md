## 🧠 Problem It Solves

Students usually trade through:
- WhatsApp groups  
- Instagram posts  
- Word of mouth  

This leads to:
- Scams and fake listings  
- Lost messages  
- No payment security  
- No order tracking  
- No moderation  

**Nile Mart** replaces this chaos with a structured, secure, and professional marketplace built specifically for students.
